Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This repository is a collection of the prediction models I've built using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. From simple regression models to advanced reinforcement learning, I've explored a wide range of AI concepts.

ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Inside?
I've worked on different types of models, including:

âœ… Regression â€“ Predicting continuous values (like prices or trends).
âœ… Classification â€“ Identifying categories (spam detection, image recognition, etc.).
âœ… Clustering â€“ Grouping similar data points (like customer segmentation).
âœ… Associative Rule Learning â€“ Finding patterns in data (market basket analysis).
âœ… Reinforcement Learning â€“ Training AI to make decisions (game-playing bots).
âœ… NLP (Natural Language Processing) â€“ Text analysis, sentiment detection, chatbots.
âœ… Deep Learning â€“ Building neural networks (CNNs, RNNs, etc.).
âœ… Dimensionality Reduction â€“ Simplifying complex datasets (PCA, t-SNE).
âœ… XGBoost â€“ Powerful gradient boosting for structured data.
